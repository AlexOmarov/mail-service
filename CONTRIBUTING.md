## Contributing

New branch with story slack (`feature/<QUEUE_CODE>-<TICKET_NUMBER>`) as a name should be created for each new task.

Each contribution to master branch MUST include following steps:

1. Changelog update with number of each task written under the new version
2. New unit tests for each new functionality (or changed class)
3. Updates of README (if some serious changes have been made)
4. Updates of documentation and UML schemas (if workflows are updated / added)
5. Updates of database schemas (if data model has been changed)
